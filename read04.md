# Structure of a Web Pages using HTML

### HTML(HyperText Markup Language):
HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language." Imagine it as a digital language used to create and organize the content of a website, like a *skeleton* that gives structure to a web page.In HTML, we use things called "tags" to create different elements on a web page, such as paragraphs, headings, images, and links. Tags are like labels that tell the web browser how to display the content.

### By using a combination of tags, you can create a variety of content and build an entire website. When you visit a website, your browser reads the HTML code and displays the content according to the instructions provided by the tags.

## 3 main part of HTML:
1. Declaration: The very first line of an HTML document is the doctype declaration, which tells the web browser the version of HTML being used. For HTML5, the most recent version, the declaration is !DOCTYPE html

2. The head tag is the section of the document that contains metadata, which is information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the webpage. The head is enclosed within tags. It typically includes the page title (displayed in the browser's title bar or tab), character encoding, links to stylesheets or scripts, and other information useful for browsers or search engines.

3. Body: The body is the main part of the HTML document, where you put all the content that will be visible to users on the webpage. It is enclosed within the body tags. This is where you'll use various HTML tags to create headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, tables, and other elements to build the structure and content of the page.
