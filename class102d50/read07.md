# Javascript

## What are functions?

* Functions can be stored in variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and even returned as values by other functions.
* Functions can be called or invoked by using their name followed by parentheses, which may include arguments or values to be passed as parameters.
* Functions are a way to organize and reuse code, which makes programming more efficient and less repetitive.
* Functions can take input or parameters, which are values that are passed to the function when it's called.
* Functions can be defined using the "function" keyword, followed by a name and a set of parentheses, which may include parameters.    
 
 **What is an operator?**

1. Assignment operator (=): Assigns a value to a variable.

2. Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %): Perform basic math operations on numbers.

3. Comparison operators (==, !=, ===, !==, >, <, >=, <=): Compare values and return a Boolean value of true or false.

4. Logical operators (&&, ||, !): Combine and manipulate Boolean values to form more complex expressions.

5. Ternary operator (a ? b : c): A shorthand way of writing an if-else statement.

6. Increment operator (++) and Decrement operator (--): Increases or decreases the value of a variable by 1.

7. Typeof operator: Returns the data type of a value.

8. Conditional (ternary) operator: A shorthand way to write an if-else statement.

### Event Listener(clicking button function/user)

n JavaScript, an event listener is a function or piece of code that waits for a specific event to occur on a web page, such as a user clicking a button, hovering over an element, or submitting a form.

When an event occurs, the event listener is triggered, and the associated function is executed. Event listeners are used to add interactivity to web pages and to respond to user actions in real-time.
**for example**

document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
  // code to be executed when the button is clicked
});

### Top 5 Expression

**Arithmetic** expressions: Perform basic math operations on numbers 

**String** expressions: Combine two or more strings together using the concatenation operator (+).

**Conditional** expressions: Evaluate a condition and return one value if the condition is true, or a different value if it is false. This is often done using the ternary operator (a ? b : c).

**Assignment expressions**: Assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator (=).

**Function expressions**: Define a function as a value and assign it to a variable. This allows you to pass functions as arguments to other functions, or to store functions as properties of objects.

Expressions are an essential part of programming in JavaScript, and are used to perform a wide variety of tasks, from simple arithmetic calculations to complex function definitions. By understanding and using these expressions effectively, you can write more efficient and powerful JavaScript code.
