## Markdown

Using markdown, you can quickly and easily add headings, lists, and other formatting elements to your code files. Markdown is also a great way to create documentation for your code. By including explanations and examples in the  markdown files, you can help others understand your code and how to use it. Another benefit of using markdown is that it's widely supported and can be used in many different programs and platforms(Github repo). 

### What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?

(#) How many do you need to create the largest heading ? 1(#)

(#) How many do you need to create the smallest heading? 6(#)

When making text **bold** or _italicized_ for emphasis in Markdown language, the best practice is to use the asterisk symbol (*) or the underscore symbol (_). It's important to note that the opening and closing symbols must be the same and must not be separated by any spaces or other characters.

### The three symbols use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown are:

* ### **Asterisk (*)**

* ### **Plus sign (+)**

* ### **Hyphen/minus sign (-)**
