## Javascript

### What is Javascript?

JavaScript allows you to add interactivity to web pages. It can be used to create animations, handle user input (like form submission), and change the appearance of a page based on user actions. JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers

## All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.Basic concepts of JavaScript:Variables:

* Variables store values that can be used and manipulated throughout your code. You can create a variable using the var, let, or const keyword, followed by the variable name.
* Data types: JavaScript has a few basic data types, including numbers, strings (text), and booleans (true/false). You can also create more complex data structures using arrays and objects.
* Operators: Operators are used to perform actions on values and variables, such as addition, subtraction, and comparison.
* Functions: Functions are blocks of code that can be defined and called by name. They can accept input (called parameters) and return a value.
* Control structures: Control structures allow you to control the flow of your code. Examples include if statements, for loops, and while loops.

### These five concepts provide a solid foundation for working with JavaScript.

1. Syntax and data types: Understand the basic syntax!
2. Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation: The DOM is a tree-like representation of a web page's structure
3. Event handling: Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, such as clicks, scrolls, or key presses
4. Asynchronous programming: JavaScript often interacts with external resources, like APIs, that can take time to respond
5. Best practices and debugging: Write clean, maintainable, and efficient code by following best practices like using proper **indentation, meaningful variable names, and modular functions**. Learn how to use browser developer tools to debug your JavaScript code, set breakpoints, and inspect variables and the DOM.

**Interpreted** languages: In an interpreted language like JavaScript, the code you write (called source code) is read and executed line by line by a program called an interpreter. The interpreter translates the human-readable code into a form that the computer can understand and execute. This process happens at runtime, meaning the translation occurs while the code is being executed.

const: Use for today
var: Do not Use
(nothing): Do not use
