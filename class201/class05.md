 HTML: Image Types and Choosing Image Formats

* Accessibility

* Social sharing: When a web page is shared on social media platforms, the alt text is often used as the default description for the image being shared.

Improve accesibility:

* Use appropriate file formats:
* Provide text descriptions
* Provide high-contrast images
* Consider using SVG

### GIF

GIF and SVG are two different types of image file formats used on the internet. GIF images are made up of pixels and can be animated, but can look blurry when enlarged. SVG images, on the other hand, are made up of lines and shapes that are defined by mathematical equations and can be resized without losing quality. SVG images are often used for logos and icons because they can be easily customized and changed.

### Two ways to add spacing around characters displayed in an h1 element

1. Use the letter-spacing property: This property adds or subtracts space between characters in the text. For example, letter-spacing: 1px would add 1 pixel of space between each character in the h1 element.

2. Use the padding property: This property adds space between the border of an element and its content. For example, padding: 10px would add 10 pixels of space around the text in the h1 element.
