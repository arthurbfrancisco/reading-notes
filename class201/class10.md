## Debugging

### Syntax

1. **Key differences between Syntax and Logic Errors:**
Syntax errors are mistakes in the code's structure or grammar, preventing it from being parsed or executed, while logic errors are flaws in the code's logic, causing incorrect or unexpected results even though the code runs without any syntax issues.

2. **Past encountered errors and corrections:**
In past lab assignments, I've encountered errors like missing brackets, incorrect variable names, and wrong function calls. To correct them, I utilized debugging tools, code reviews, and thorough testing to identify the cause and fix the issues.

3. **Topic's influence on long-term goals:**
Understanding and dealing with errors is crucial for long-term success as a developer. As I continue to learn and grow, mastering error handling and debugging techniques will improve my coding skills, efficiency, and problem-solving abilities, helping me achieve my career goals.

### Debugger

1. **Describing the JavaScript Debugger:**
The JavaScript Debugger is a powerful tool built into modern web browsers that helps developers identify and fix issues in their JavaScript code. It allows you to pause the execution of your code, step through it line by line, inspect variable values, and examine the call stack to understand the flow of your program. This helps in finding and resolving both syntax and logic errors more efficiently.

2. **Breakpoint definition:**
A breakpoint is a marked line in your code where the JavaScript Debugger will pause the execution of the program. This allows you to inspect the state of your code at a specific point, examine variables, and step through the code to understand its behavior better. Breakpoints are useful for isolating issues and debugging complex code more effectively.

3. **Call stack definition:**
The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the active functions and their invocation order in a program. When a function is called, it is added to the top of the call stack. Once the function finishes executing, it is removed from the stack. The call stack is essential for understanding the flow of your program, and it helps in identifying issues related to function calls, recursion, and execution order.
