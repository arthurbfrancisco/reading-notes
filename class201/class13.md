## Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

The article "Local Storage and How to Use It" on Smashing Magazine explains how to use HTML5's Local Storage feature to store data on the user's browser. The author provides examples of how to use Local Storage to store data such as user preferences, shopping cart information, and form data. The article also explains the advantages of Local Storage over cookies and how it can be used to create a better user experience. Overall, the article offers a useful guide for web developers looking to implement Local Storage in their projects.

1. A developer would use local storage for a web application to store data on the user's browser rather than on a server. This allows the application to quickly retrieve data and provide a better user experience. Local storage is also persistent, so the data is available even if the user closes the browser or restarts their computer.

2. Local storage is not secure and sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card details, should not be stored in it. Additionally, local storage has a limited storage capacity, typically around 5-10 MB, so developers should avoid storing large amounts of data in it.

3. Local storage can store various types of data, including strings, numbers, and objects. To store data as a specific type, such as a number, developers can use the appropriate JavaScript method to convert it before storing it in local storage. For example, the parseInt() method can be used to convert a string to an integer before storing it in local storage.
