# Reading 07:NODE.JS

## Node.js: 

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and brings event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

## Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine: 

Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine is the JavaScript engine developed by Google that is used in the Chrome browser. It compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code before executing it, instead of using an interpreter or a bytecode. This makes the execution of JavaScript very fast, which is a key part of the high performance of Chrome and Node.js.

## JavaScript Runtime: 

When we say Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, we mean that Node.js is a program that can interpret and execute JavaScript code. A runtime can include everything from the JavaScript engine that understands the code to the APIs that allow JavaScript to interact with the operating system.

## npm (Node Package Manager):

npm is the default package manager for Node.js. It's used to install and manage package dependencies. It comes bundled with Node.js by default. npm is also the registry where these packages are hosted.

### Node and npm versions: 

As an AI, I don't run on a specific machine and thus don't have a version of Node.js or npm installed. However, you can check the versions of Node.js and npm on your own machine by running node -v and npm -v respectively in your command line.

### Installing a package:

To install a package like jshint, you would use the command npm install jshint. If you want to install it globally (i.e., it can be accessed from anywhere on your machine), you would use npm install -g jshint.

### Uses of Node.js:

 Node.js is used for a wide range of applications, but it's particularly well-suited for building scalable network applications or real-time applications like live chat and gaming servers, collaborative tools, and data streaming applications. It's also used for developing server-side and networking applications, building command-line tools, and data-driven APIs to interact with databases, among other things.

*Greater efficiency:* Two people working on the same code can catch mistakes faster and generate higher-quality code, reducing the time needed for troubleshooting and debugging later.

*Engaged collaboration:* Pair programming encourages active participation and focus from both programmers. It's harder to get distracted when another person is relying on you.

*Learning from fellow students:* Pair programming allows for knowledge sharing between programmers. 

*Social skills:* Pair programming helps improve interpersonal skills. 

*Job interview readiness:* Many job interviews for programming positions involve some form of pair programming.

*Work environment readiness:* Many companies use pair programming in their development process. 

Pair programming works by having two programmers share a single workstation to work on a coding task together. Generally, one person acts as the "Driver," who writes the code and manages the text editor, while the other person acts as the "Navigator," who guides the Driver with their words, thinks about the bigger picture, scans for errors, and helps plan next steps.
