## Markdown
### Why do we use Markdown?
### What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?
# (#) How many do you need to create the largest heading?
##### (######) How many do you need to create the smallest heading?

#### *When making text bold or italicized for emphasis in Markdown language, the best practice is to use the asterisk symbol (*) or the underscore symbol (_).* **For bold text, you can use either two asterisks (**) or two underscores (__) to enclose the text that you want to make bold. For example, **bold text** or __bold text__ would both result in bold text.** For italicized text, you can use either one _asterisk (*) or one underscore (_)_ to enclose the text that you want to italicize. For example, *italicized text* or _italicized text_ would both result in italicized text.
## It's important to note that the opening and closing symbols must be the same and must not be separated by any spaces or other characters.
