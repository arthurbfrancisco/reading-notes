# Markdown
Using markdown, you can quickly and easily add headings, lists, and other formatting elements to your code files. This can make it easier to navigate through your code and find specific sections that you're looking for. Markdown is also a great way to create documentation for your code. By including explanations and examples in your markdown files, you can help others understand your code and how to use it. Another benefit of using markdown is that it's widely supported and can be used in many different programs and platforms(Github repo). 

### What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?
# (#) How many do you need to create the largest heading?
##### (######) How many do you need to create the smallest heading?

#### *When making text bold or italicized for emphasis in Markdown language, the best practice is to use the asterisk symbol (*) or the underscore symbol (_).* **For bold text, you can use either two asterisks (**) or two underscores (__) to enclose the text that you want to make bold. For example, **bold text** or __bold text__ would both result in bold text.** For italicized text, you can use either one _asterisk (*) or one underscore (_)_ to enclose the text that you want to italicize. For example, *italicized text* or _italicized text_ would both result in italicized text.
## It's important to note that the opening and closing symbols must be the same and must not be separated by any spaces or other characters.

### The three symbols to can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown are:

* ### **Asterisk (*)**
* ### **Plus sign (+)**
* ### **Hyphen/minus sign (-)**
